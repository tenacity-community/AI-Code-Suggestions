## Introduction

At Tenacity Learn, our mission is to empower learners of all levels with tools and guidance to enhance their coding skills. We believe in the power of personalized learning, and this project is a key component of our platform.

Our AI Code Suggestions feature leverages the capabilities of Azure OpenAI to analyze the code written by users and provide live suggestions to improve their code. The AI system does not simply provide answers but rather offers hints and suggestions, helping users understand and rectify their mistakes. This collaborative learning approach is designed to foster a deeper understanding of coding concepts.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is the `model.py` file, which serves as the interface between our Tenacity Learn platform and Azure OpenAI. Let's take a closer look at the key components of this file:

### Environment Variables

To ensure the security of our Azure OpenAI integration, we use environment variables to store sensitive information, such as the API key and endpoint. These variables include:
- `AZURE_OAI_KEY`: Your Azure OpenAI API key.
- `AZURE_OAI_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint for the Azure OpenAI service.
- `AZURE_OAI_MODEL`: The specific Azure OpenAI model to be used.
- `PROMPT`: The initial prompt to be provided to the AI system.

### Code Example

The code example in the `code` variable serves as the input for the AI system. Users can replace this code with their own, and the AI will provide suggestions based on the input provided.

### OpenAI Configuration

We set up the OpenAI configuration by specifying the API type, base URL, version, and API key. This ensures that the AI requests are directed to the appropriate Azure OpenAI model.

### Sending Requests to Azure OpenAI

We send a request to the Azure OpenAI model with the user's code and initial prompt. The response from the AI system is then displayed to the user, providing suggestions and feedback on the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have the necessary environment variables set up. Make sure to create a `.env` file and store your Azure OpenAI API key, endpoint, model, and prompt as mentioned in the `model.py` file.

## Usage

The usage of this project is straightforward. Users can replace the example code in the `code` variable with their own code. When they run the `model.py` script, it sends a request to Azure OpenAI, and the AI system provides suggestions based on the code provided.

Here's a brief overview of the steps:

1. Set up your environment variables in the `.env` file.
2. Replace the `code` variable with your code.
3. Run the `model.py` script.
4. Review the AI-generated suggestions for your code.
